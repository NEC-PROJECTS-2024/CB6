### INTRODUCTION
Due to the advanced color printing technology,fake currency notes has increased rapidly [7]. Many banks and other major organizations have installed automatic machinery to detect counterfeit notes,but it is extremely difficult for the common person to distinguish between real and counterfeit currency. This has resulted in increased corruption in our country. Computers and mobile phones are become an unavoidable part of our life. By using this technology even an average person with computer, tablet or smart phone can detect the counterfeit notes. Images  are captured with the smartphone camera and supplied into the model. Our model provides a binary image classification job with two classes: fake and real. By training the model on  the generated dataset, we can learn from it and use it to detect counterfeit notes. Our project uses ensembled model, combination of three machine learning models such as  Random Forest, KNN  and Gradient Boosting Classifier. By ensembling the three machine learning models can make more generalized  model to   predict   the  fake  notes
